        <h3>Welcome To The Tatra Mountains</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Tatra Mountains are located at the border between Poland and Slovakia in eastern Central Europe. They cover the area of approx. 785 km2, with approximately 78% of their total area belonging to Slovakia and 22,3% belonging to Poland. The elevational gradient reaches from around 700 m a.s.l. to the highest peak Gerlachoský štit at 2655 m a.s.l. The Tatra Mountains (despite being part of a much greater mountain range, namely the Carpathian Mountains) are often referred to as the smallest high mountain range in the world, with 28 individual peaks above 2500 m but only about 80 km length along its main ridge. <a href="http://ecopotential-project.eu/site-studies/protected-areas/38-tatra-mountains.html">Source</a>

       <h3>Facts About Tatra</h3>
       <p>The Tatras are Poland’s only alpine-type mountains, indeed forming the highest part of the huge transboundary arc that is SE Europe’s Carpathian chain. They cover just 785 km2, being only 57 km long in a straight line, and as little as 19 km wide. Yet they have a true mountain feel about them, rising to their highest elevation at 2654m Gerlach, on the Slovakian side.
        The Tatras are conventionally divided into the Western Tatras, High Tatras and White Tatras. As has been implied, they form part of the state border between Poland and Slovakia that leaves just one-fifth (175 km2) on the Polish side, albeit with several fragments of extreme beauty and a highest summit – the north-western apex of Rysy – at an impressive 2499 m a.s.l.
        The climate here is that of mountains in the temperate zone, and there are marked high-mountain features. Snow covers the higher slopes, ridges and peaks for 7-8 months of the year and a strong (warm) föhn-type wind called the halny blows at regular intervals. <a href="https://discoverzakopane.com/tatra-mountains.html">Source</a></p>

        <h3>Morskie Oko</h3>
        <p>Morskie Oko Lake
            This is the largest and the most beautiful lake in the Tatra Mountains. Morskie Oko (literally: “The Eye of the Sea”) is surrounded by the highest summits of the Polish Tatras. It lies in a basin which forms the upper part of the Rybi Potok (“Fish Brook”) Valley. The old name of the lake is Rybi Staw (“Fish Pond”) after trout living in its water.
            Morskie Oko has been famous for its beauty and uniqueness for a long time. "It is said that being in the Tatras and not visiting Morskie Oko Lake is like being in Rome and not seeing the Pope. It is so renowned that many tourists travel to the Tatra Mountains just to see Morskie Oko." These words were written by Walery Eljasz in 1873 and after so many years they are still true, because you can skip Łomnica Peak, leave out Mylna Cave, omit Mount Kościelec, but Morskie Oko Lake is a must-see. And the majority of tourists coming to the Tatra Mountains are bound to visit it.
